# About this project
This is a simple implementation of a URL shortner which uses an AIOHTTP to spawn up a Asynchronous HTTP Server & expose two endpoints
1. /shorten which takes url as body parameter and returns a shortened version of the URL
2. /{code} which redirects the user to the long URL

# HTTP SERVER is running using AIOHTTP
